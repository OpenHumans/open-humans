This is not focused on automated tests (although those are nice).
Report anything, from basic "ran the code locally" to a design review.

For example, the following might be reported for a PR fixing a bug in
handling the "title" field a submitted form:

  * passed automated testing locally
  * ran locally to test manually:
    * reproduced bug
    * confirmed corrected behavior
    * tested behavior is as expected when form data is initially
      incorrect and corrected on re-entry
