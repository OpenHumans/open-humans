        Public data has the potential to help many – from students to
        researchers to citizen scientists! Open Humans allows members
        to publicly share data. Which data you share is up to you,
        and you can turn off sharing at any time.

        <b>To activate this feature, we require a member to demonstrate an
        understanding of potential risks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Choosing to publicly share personal data also has potential
        risks. Because of this, the option to publicly share feature is not available by
        default. We celebrate sharing, but public sharing
        of personal data is not for everyone. Each individual experiences
        different risks, and has different preferences.

      <h3>More information</h3>
      <p>
        When sharing your data, you’ll need to understand that the data may
        be very identifiable. This means that someone may figure out your
        identity, even if you don’t share your name. Some members do
        not attempt to be anonymous, and associate their name with their Open
        Humans account and data.
