<h3 id="api-exchange-member">API data access: Project member endpoint</h3>

<p>
  Using access tokens for specific users, OAuth2 projects can use this
  endpoint to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>retrieve the user's project member ID</li>
  <li>access other data associated with the project member</li>
</ul>

<p>
{% if oauth2_project %}
  There are two ways to use this endpoint.  The first is to send a secure GET
  request (using 'https') to the following URL with the <code>access_token</code>
  parameter set to the user's OAuth2 "access token":
</p>
<p><code>
  https://www.openhumans.org/api/direct-sharing/project/exchange-member/?access_token=&lt;USER_ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;
</code></p>
<p>
  The second is to{% else %}The way to use this endpoint is to{% endif %} send a
  secure GET request ('https') to the following URL with the
  <code>access_token</code> parameter set to the project's "master access token"
  and the <code>project_member_id</code> set to the project member's "project
  member id".
<p>
  This returns JSON-formatted data that can be used to
  programmatically access and retrieve data files and other information for this
  specific project member. Data file information is paginated and,
  by default, lists a maximum of 100 data files. The returned JSON
  includes: "count", which is the total number of data files, "next",
  the URL for the next page of data files (if there are more to be listed),
  and "previous", the URL for the previous page of data files (if one exists).
</p>

{% if oauth2_project %}
<h4>Social log in with an Open Humans account</h4>

<p>
  This endpoint can also be used to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_login">
  "social login"</a> &ndash; users could log in to your site "through" Open Humans.
  If you expect users to be Open Humans members, this could simplify account management.
</p>
{% endif %}

{% if oauth2_project %}
<h3 id="api-access-master-token">API data access: master access token endpoint</h3>
<p>
  In addition to traditional OAuth2 access tokens, your project will also have
  access to a "master access token" and associated APIs.
</p>
<p>
  <b>We recommend OAuth2 projects use OAuth2 API endpoints when possible.</b>
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to use master access token endpoints, consult
  <a href="{% url 'direct-sharing:on-site-data-access' %}">documentation for
  "On-site" projects</a>.
</p>
{% elif on_site_project %}

{% include 'direct-sharing/partials/about-master-token.html' %}

<h3 id="api-access-master-token">API data access: master access token endpoint</h3>

<p>

  To access private data shared with your project, send a secure GET request
  (using 'https') to <code>/api/direct-sharing/project/members/</code>
  with the <code>access_token</code> parameter set to your project's
  "master access token".  This returns JSON-formatted data  with a list of
  the project's members as well as the first ten files that member has shared
  with the project.  In addition, it provides:  <code>file_count</code>, which tallies the
  total number of files the member has shared with the project, as well as
  <code>exchange_member</code>, which has a link to that member's exchange api endpoint,
  providing access to the full set of files.  For more information on this endpoint,
  please see the <a href="#api-exchange-member">exchange-member
    endpoint documentation.</a>

</p>

<p>
  For example:
</p>

<p>
  <code>https://www.openhumans.org/api/direct-sharing/project/members/?access_token=&lt;MASTER_ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;</code>
</p>

<p>
  This returns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON formatted</a>
  data that can be used to programmatically access and retrieve data and files
  for your project members.
</p>

<h4>Download URLs</h4>

<p>
  Data files for members can be retrieved using the <code>download_url</code>
  information. <b>These URLs are temporary authorizations that will expire.</b>
  You should use a program to immediately to retrieve the data files you need.
</p>

<h4>Pagination</h4>

<p>
  The API uses pagination via the <code>offset</code> querystring
  parameter; the default page size is 100 results. A smaller or larger page
  size can be specified with the <code>limit</code> parameter.
