      <b>Works immediately.</b><br>
      You can immediately use all these features, but your project is
      limited to a maximum of 20 users. You'll need to apply for project
      approval to remove this cap. Once approved, Open Humans will invite members
      to join your project.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Access to private data.</b><br>
      Select which data sources you want to request access to. If a member
      authorizes sharing with your project, you'll immediately have access to
      any of their data from those sources via our API.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to only access <em>public</em> data for a member, you should
      instead request username access (see below).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Username information is optional.</b><br>
      Each member's data comes via a random project-specific member ID.
      You will not receive username access unless you request it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not receiving username access can improve security and facilitate IRB
      review &ndash; if data is anonymous, the review might be expedited.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, if you only want to work with <em>public data</em>,
      you can request username access (and no data sources). You'll be able to
      retrieve the member's public data using the
      <a href="{% url 'public-data-api' %}">Public Data API</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Send messages to project members.</b><br>
      You can request authorization to send messages to your project
      members. This messaging does not reveal their email or username to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Messages can target specific project member IDs and can contain the
      project member ID within the message. That means you can use embed the ID
      in a custom URL for a survey, to collect additiional information from a
      member.

      <b>Forward member to a project URL.</b><br>
      You may optionally specify a URL for a member to be forwarded to after
      they enroll and authorize your project. This URL can have their project
      member ID embedded within it (e.g. as a parameter for a form).

      <b>Upload data to member accounts.</b><br>
      Projects can be data sources: you can upload data for a member
      to their account. This data will be private, accessible only by your
      project and the member. The member can download the data and manage its
      sharing within Open Humans.

      reusable application for the Django web framework</a> to interact with
      Open Humans or

      for you.
