<h3>Studies and activities in development</h3>

<p>
  Here's some of the studies and activities that researchers and other Open
  Humans members are currently drafting. Some of these may become active
  projects on the site. Activities are approved by Open Humans on a
  case-by-case basis, and sudies must have approval from their institution's
  ethics board. (That can take some time!)
