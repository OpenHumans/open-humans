<h3>Manage projects requesting private data authorization</h3>

<div class="well">
  <b>Welcome to our new private data sharing feature!</b> Please consider
  yourself an "alpha" user. We're developing this feature. We highly value
  your feedback and would love to hear from you. You can email us at
  <a href="mailto:support@openhumans.org">support@openhumans.org</a>.
</div>

<p>
  How will Open Humans members consent and share their data with your study
  or activity? There are two options. The choice here affects the technical
  process for members consenting to your study and opting to share data with
  you.
</p>

<hr>
<h4>OAuth2 projects</h4>

<p>
  Are you running your own website with user accounts? You probably
  want the "OAuth2" method, where you send users to authorize data
  access on our website using an OAuth2 process. The OAuth2 process
  can also be used for "social login". Running your own website
  maximizes your ability to work with individuals, but requires a lot
  of technical ability!
</p>

<p>
  For a study, this could imply the following process:
  <ol>
    <li>
      You provide Open Humans with your study's URL for enrollment &ndash;
      we'll share this with members interested in contributing to your study.
    </li>
    <li>
      Participants go to your website to perform informed consent and
      enroll.
    </li>
    <li>
      You use an OAuth2 connection to request access to their Open Humans data.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h5 style="margin-top:20px;">Your OAuth2 projects</h5>

{% if oauth2 %}
<table class="table table-hover">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Project name</th><th>Actions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  {% for project in oauth2 %}
  <tr>
    <td>{{ project.name }}</td>
    <td>
      <a href="{% url 'private-sharing:detail-oauth2' pk=project.pk %}">view</a>
      <a href="{% url 'private-sharing:update-oauth2' pk=project.pk %}">edit</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
  {% endfor %}
</table>
{% else %}
  <ul><li><p>You have no OAuth2 projects.</p></li></ul>
{% endif %}

<p>
  <a href="{% url 'private-sharing:create-oauth2' %}"
      class="btn btn-default">
    Create a new OAuth2 data request project</a>
</p>

<hr>
<h3>On-site projects</h3>

<p>
  Not a website techie? No worries! You can give us your consent
  text and we'll present it to our users on this website. You'll
  be able to retrieve the data members share with you via our API.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to ask members to do something more Â­&ndash; fill out a
  survey, for example &ndash; you have the option of forwarding them to
  a URL of your choosing. Their project-specific user ID code can be embedded
  in this URL. That means you could (for example) send them to a Google Form
  with the user ID code in a pre-filled field.
</p>

<p>
  For a study, this could imply the following process:
  <ol>
    <li>
      You direct users to your study's consent page on Open Humans. This
      presents the text of your informed consent. They may "Consent" or
      "Decline".
    </li>
    <li>
      After a member consents, they are presented with a data sharing request.
      (This is the same authorization page as presented for an OAuth2 project.)
    </li>
    <li>
      After a member authorizes, we sent them to a URL you've provided for a
      Google Form you created. Their project-specific user code is inserted to
      create a pre-populated form answer.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
