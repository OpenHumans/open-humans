It's our mission to empower you with your personal data, to explore and
share for the purposes of education, health, and research.

To make sure you get future emails from us, add our email to your "contacts".

Adding Data

Your account can be used to collect and manage any personal data you
choose to connect to Open Humans. We have activities created by us, as
well as other members, that enable adding data from a variety of sources.

Check out data sources: {{ add_data_url }}

------------------------------------------------------------
Explore and Share

We also support a variety of activities that engage members in
exploring their data, as well as contributing it to group activities â€“
from academic studies to citizen science projects. Your data is private
by default: you choose when to share it.

Activities to explore or share data: {{ explore_share_url }}

------------------------------------------------------------
Public Data Sharing

Data is private by default. But sometimes people decide to make
some of their data a "public resource". For each data source, you can opt
to turn on public sharing.

To enable this feature, you'll need to activate it here:
{{ public_sharing_url }}

You'll be able to turn "public" status on (and off) for each of your data
sources on individual activity pages.

News and Updates

You've opted to not receive news and update emails. Maybe you'd like to
enable this? We really don't email much! We email to tell Members about new
studies and activities, and give updates about progress in current studies.
You can change this on your account settings page:
{% url 'my-member-settings' %}

{% endif %}

Thank you again for joining Open Humans!

Mad, Bastian, and the rest of the Open Humans team.
