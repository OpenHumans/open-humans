        <i>Open Humans</i>  is a platform that allows you to <b>upload, connect,
        and privately store your personal data</b> – such as genetic, activity,
        or social media data. Once you've added data, you can to donate it:
        you might choose to <a href="{% url 'public-data:home' %}">share some publicly
        </a>, and you can <b>join and
        <a href="{% url 'explore-share' %}">contribute to diverse research projects</a></b>.
        Thus, we turn the traditional
        research pipeline on its head: you are at the center and in control of
        when you share your data. We want to empower you to
        <b>explore your data</b> – for example, enabling you to
        <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/activity/genevieve-genome-report/">analyze
          your genome</a> or
        <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/activity/twitter-archive-analyzer/">your
          Twitter data</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For researchers and citizen scientists, <i>Open Humans</i> offers <b>a toolbox
        to <a href="{% url 'create' %}">easily create new projects</a></b> which can
        efficiently ask an engaged audience of participants to join and contribute.
        or join research projects.
       So far our community has contributed 19 different tools to enable data import
       from external sources at the touch of a button, as well as numerous projects
       that help members explore data and invite them to contribute to research.
       Thanks to this growing community, new data sources, visualizations, and
       research projects are continuously becoming available.
       Take a look into <a href="{% url 'statistics' %}">how many people</a> are
       already using <i>Open Humans</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
      All of this makes <i>Open Humans</i>
      <b><a href="http://slackin.openhumans.org">a vibrant community</a></b>.
      People are intrigued by their own data! For this reason, there is no single
      user profile: we are researchers; patients; data scientists;
      citizen scientists; any and all people who want to learn more about themselves.
      And they have continued to be enthusiastic, motivated, and truly engaged in the
      work of the organization.
      </p>

      <p>
      We'd love for you to join us in this, analyzing your data, creating projects
      and adding data sources. <b>Together we can help empower a
      thriving community to make the best use of their personal data.</b>
