        <p>Open Humans is a project of <a
          href="http://www.personalgenomes.org">PersonalGenomes.org</a> – a
          501(c)(3) nonprofit – and is funded by Knight Foundation and the
          Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  Other groundbreaking initiatives from
          PersonalGenomes.org include the
          <a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/pgp">
            Personal Genome Project</a> and the
          <a href="http://getconference.org">GET conference</a>.</p>

        <p>Open Humans aims to break down data silos in human health and
          research. We believe data has a huge potential to live and grow beyond
          the boundaries a single study or program. Our online portal allows
          members to aggregate data from the research they participate in. By
          connecting individuals willing to share existing research data about
          themselves with researchers who are interested in using that data,
          data can be re-used and built upon.</p>

        <h3>Public Data Sharing</h3>

        <p>The first Open Humans study is our "Public Data Sharing" study.
          Members who join this study will be enabled to publicly share their
          diverse research data on Open Humans - including genome, microbiome,
          and viral surveillance research data. While extremely valuable, this
          data is highly identifiable. Privacy cannot be guaranteed.
          Participants who share publicly are opening up their own biology and
          health data to create a valuable public resource.

        <p>
          Some Open Humans members generously choose to publicly share their
          data. We hope this data can be a public resource for research,
          education, and other diverse purposes. If you're interested in using

        <p>
          We want to support researchers interested in giving raw data access
          to their participants. Reasons you might want to do this include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>see <b>your study listed</b> on Open&nbsp;Humans</li>
          <li>make your <b>participants valued</b> partners in research</li>
          <li>pursue new methods of <b>data sharing</b></li>
          <li>create a path to <b>public data</b>, shared by some
            participants</li>
          <li>see <b>your work cited</b> when other studies use your&nbsp;data
        </ul>

        <h3>Work with our members</h3>

        <p>
          We're also interested in enabling studies to work directly with
          Open Humans members, to receive data (private as well as public) and
          to enable additional follow-up research (e.g. surveys or new
          samples). Benefits for your study include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>working with a <b>motivated community</b> of members
          <li>access to <b>private data</b> members choose to share
            with&nbsp;you</li>
          <li>ability to perform <b>additional research</b> with members</li>
          <li>see <b>your study featured</b> by Open Humans</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Open Humans believes researchers that work with our members should
          also be committed to building the commons: we expect research
          partners to connect their studies and return data to participants.
          By doing this, research partners commit to transparency and equity,
          and their participants can use and share the resulting data.
        </p>

        <p>
          We're also available to assist you. We have lots of experience
          with conducting studies online, including: building websites,
          online informed consent, and APIs for integrating with Open Humans.
          Consider engaging us to build the informatics and operations needed
          to make your study a success!
