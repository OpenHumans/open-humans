        The <i>Open Humans</i> community is more than just a collection of
        projects and individual members. Together we are envisioning a different
        way to do research, putting individuals front and center.
        So far <b> {{ number_members }} people have joined us</b> in this effort,
        with {{ number_members_with_data }} of them already having uploaded
        data. In total <b>our community has uploaded {{number_files}} data
        sets!</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Our dedicated community members have built numerous projects on
        <i>Open Humans</i>. <b>{{active_projects}} such projects are running
        right now</b>, in addition to {{finished_projects}} projects that have
        already been concluded. And it does not stop there, a <b>further
        {{planned_projects}} projects are in development right now</b>.
        And if you have an idea for your own project you
        <a href="{% url 'create' %}">can get started right away</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      We'd love for you to join us in this, analyzing your data, creating projects
      and adding new data sources. <b>Together we can help empower a
      thriving community to make the best use of their personal data.</b>
