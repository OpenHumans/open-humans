    <h4>What can I do as an Open Humans member?</h4>
    <p>
      You can start right away by joining some of the studies we're partnered
      with. Once you're enrolled, you'll be able to connect that account and
      earn a badge on your profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a member, you can look forward to new opportunities to donate your
      data to researchers – and receive access to new data in return!
    </p>
    <h4 style="margin-top:30px;">What studies can I currently join?</h4>
    <p>
      We’re opening with three research partners:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>American Gut</b> - learn about the bacteria that live on you and
          inside you
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>GoViral</b> - take samples when you get sick to find out what virus
        you had
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Harvard Personal Genome Project</b> - sequencing and publicly
        sharing whole genome data
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Check out <a href="{% url 'activities' %}">our activities page</a> to
      learn more about participating in these studies.
    </p>
    <h4 style="margin-top:30px;" style="margin-top:10px;">
      I'm a researcher. Can I get my research study added to your site?</h4>
    <p>
      We'd love to expand our research partners! Learn
      <a href="{% url 'about' %}#research">how to connect your research study
      </a> if you're interested in working with Open Humans members and data.
    </p>
    <h4 style="margin-top:30px;">What is your "public data sharing" option?</h4>
    <p>
      We want to give people the opportunity to publicly share data research
      studies generate. Public data can be a great good for society. In many
      cases, these data wouldn't otherwise be publicly shared due to privacy
      concerns &ndash; but privacy preferences vary. While some participants
      prefer privacy, others may be happy to see their data be a public
      resource.
    </p>
    <h4 style="margin-top:30px;">How do I make my data public?</h4>
    <p>
      If you enroll in our <a href="{% url 'public-data:home' %}">Public Data
      Sharing study</a>, you'll have the ability to activate public sharing for
      any of your data files. Public sharing is always under your control, you
      choose which files to share and can turn it off at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      To learn more you can read the study's
      <a href="{% static 'public-data/docs/Consent_Document_20141212_(stamped).pdf' %}">
      research subject information and consent form (PDF)</a>. If you enroll,
      we'll ask you to review that document and take a brief enrollment quiz.
      <a href="{% url 'public-data:home' %}">Click here to start the process!
      </a>
    </p>
    <h4 style="margin-top:30px;">I have other data I want to donate!</h4>
    <p>
      We're going to continue to expand ways people can contribute. In
      particular, we're looking into adding connections to APIs from various
      sources to enable you to import personal data. The data you store &ndash;
      from studies and personal sources &ndash; can become a valuable resource
      used by future research studies.
    </p>
    <h4 style="margin-top:30px;">How can I find out when you have new studies
      or features?</h4>
    <p>
      Our newsletter will be an important way we alert members to new
      opportunities and features. If you're interested in receiving
      notifications about new studies and other Open Humans updates, make sure
      you're signed up (see <a href="{% url 'my-member-settings' %}">Profile
      Settings</a>).
    </p>
    <h4 style="margin-top:30px;">
      What does Open Humans do to keep my data secure?</h4>
    <p>
      We take data security seriously. In addition to ensuring we use secure
      methods for our website and data, we've developed a
      <a href="{% url 'community_guidelines' %}#study-websites">set of security
        guidelines</a> we expect our research partner websites to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a security concern to report to Open Humans, please let us
      know at <a href="mailto:security@openhumans.org">security@openhumans.org
      </a>.
    </p>
    <h4 style="margin-top:30px;">Can I contact an Open Humans member?</h4>
    <p>
      We will soon enable the ability for Open Humans members to contact each
      other. Members can choose whether or not to receive messages from other
      members (see <a href="{% url 'my-member-settings'%}">Profile
      Settings</a>). To send a message to an Open Humans member, you must be a
      member yourself.
    </p>
    <h4 style="margin-top:30px;">Why doesn't Open Humans require members to be
      18 or older?</h4>
    <p>
      The Open Humans site itself is not a study, but a community. Our Terms of
      Use has a lower age requirement (13 years) because we want Open Humans to
      be a place youth can explore and learn about research studies and
      resulting data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The research studies our site connects to typically require participants
      be 18 years of age, but there will be other ways Members can interact on
      the site. These could include participating in shared discussions,
      accessing data, and sending messages to other Members.
    </p>
    <h4 style="margin-top:30px;">
      I think Open Humans would be even better if it just did this one thing.

      We'd love to hear from you! Please email us at
      <a href="mailto:support@openhumans.org">support@openhumans.org</a> with
      feedback.
