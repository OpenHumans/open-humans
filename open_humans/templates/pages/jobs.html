          <h4>Part time: iOS developer</h4>
          <p>
            Open Humans has taken maintainership of the OpenPaths project
            &ndash; iOS/Android apps that allow individuals to passively record
            their location via GPS.
            <a href="http://nytlabs.com/projects/openpaths.html">OpenPaths was
              first developed by the New York Times</a> and further developed
              at UCSD.
          </p>
          <p>
            We received the server and code, but we did not develop it &ndash;
            we need your help to resurrect it!
          </p>
          <p>
            According to GitHub, the iOS app source is 95% Objective-C and
            5% Swift. We would like it to be open source, but can only do this
            if an experienced developer determines that there are no security
            concerns in sharing the code.

            According to GitHub, the Android app source is 100% Java. We would
